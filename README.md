# LogFlow

**LogFlow** is a simple yet powerful distributed event logging system built with **Python**, **Go**, **Redis**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Vagrant**.  
This project simulates a production-like event flow environment, ideal for experimenting with message queues, caching, and scalable microservice communication.

## üöÄ Features

- üîÅ **Event-based Architecture** using RabbitMQ
- üêç Producer and consumer microservices written in Python
- ü¶´ Go-based services for performance-critical parts
- üî¥ Redis for fast in-memory data access and temporary storage
- üì¶ Vagrant setup for portable and isolated development environments
- üõ†Ô∏è Dockerized components for easy deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logflow.git
   cd logflow
   ```

2. **Start Vagrant** (if used):  
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

3. **Start the services with Docker Compose**:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

---

## üì¨ Example Use Case

- Python producer pushes log events into RabbitMQ
- Go consumer processes and stores the events into Redis
- Monitoring metrics are exposed via `/metrics` endpoints
- Prometheus and Grafana can be added to monitor message rates, errors, etc.

---

## üìà Metrics and Observability

This system is compatible with:
- **Prometheus** ‚Äì to collect custom metrics (e.g., processed events, failed requests)
- **Grafana** ‚Äì to visualize metrics and set alerts

---

## üß™ Status

‚úÖ Initial setup complete  
üîß Adding more endpoints and real-time event simulation  
üß† Next: Create test scenarios and Grafana dashboards
